	<div class="original-text">The reporting clause may sometimes come in the middle of the reported clause, especially in literary styles:<br>

		'No,' she said, 'I've never seen it before.'<br>

		'Was it,' he asked, 'the first time you had spoken to Mrs Dalton?'<br>

		We can use adverbs with the reporting verb to describe the way someone said something. This is more common when the reporting<br> clause comes second:

		'I will not accept it!' he said angrily.<br>

		'Can I speak to the doctor?' she asked rather nervously.<br><br>

		Direct     : She said to me, 'You didn't break the window, did you?'<br>
		Indirect: She asked me if/whether I had broken the window.<br>
		Direct : He said to Geeta, 'You are going to the station, aren't you?'<br>
		Indirect: He asked Geeta if/ whether she was going to the station.<br>
